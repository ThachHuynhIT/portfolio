/**
 * Ô Ăn Quan board layout. For N players (2–4) the ring has N segments of 6 squares:
 * segment i = square 6i (ô quan) followed by 6i+1 … 6i+5 (the 5 ô dân owned by player i).
 * Ring size = 6N. Two players is the classic 12-square board, indexed so that +1 runs
 * left → right along the bottom row as seen by the player sitting there:
 *
 *            11  10   9   8   7          ← side 1 (players[1]) owns 7–11
 *     (0)                          (6)   ← ô quan, left and right ends
 *             1   2   3   4   5          ← side 0 (players[0]) owns 1–5
 *
 * Seen from side 1 (board rotated 180°) their row reads 7 8 9 10 11 left → right,
 * so direction +1 is "phải" (right) and −1 is "trái" (left) for whoever moves.
 * With 3 or 4 players the ring is a triangle / square drawn the same way: each player sees
 * their own segment at the bottom, running left → right.
